# 🔐 System User Login - Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The "Invalid system token" error has been fixed! The System User Management module now properly handles authentication by showing a login modal when you're not authenticated as a system user.

## 🚀 **How to Test System User Login**

### **Step 1: Access the Module**
1. **Navigate to "System Users"** in your sidebar
2. **You'll see a login modal** asking for system user credentials

### **Step 2: Use Default System User Credentials**
The seeded system users from your backend have these credentials:

#### **System Admin (Full Access)**
- **Username:** `sysadmin`
- **Password:** `AdminPassword123!@#`

#### **System Manager**
- **Username:** `sysmanager`
- **Password:** `ManagerPassword123!@#`

#### **System Operator**
- **Username:** `sysoperator`
- **Password:** `OperatorPassword123!@#`

#### **System Viewer (Read-only)**
- **Username:** `sysviewer`
- **Password:** `ViewerPassword123!@#`

### **Step 3: Login Process**
1. **Enter username** (e.g., `sysadmin`)
2. **Enter password** (e.g., `AdminPassword123!@#`)
3. **Click "Login"**
4. **You'll be authenticated** and see the full System User Management interface

## 🔧 **Backend Requirements**

Make sure your backend is running and has system users seeded:

```bash
cd community-backend
npm start
```

The system users should be automatically seeded when you start the backend server.

## 🎯 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test 1: System Admin Login**
1. Login with `sysadmin` / `AdminPassword123!@#`
2. Verify you can see all features
3. Try creating a new system user
4. Try editing existing users

### **Test 2: System Viewer Login**
1. Login with `sysviewer` / `ViewerPassword123!@#`
2. Verify you have read-only access
3. Try to create/edit users (should be restricted)

### **Test 3: Logout and Re-login**
1. Logout from system user
2. Try accessing System Users again
3. Verify login modal appears
4. Login with different credentials

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If login fails:**
1. **Check backend** - Ensure server is running on port 5000
2. **Check credentials** - Use exact username/password from above
3. **Check console** - Look for network errors
4. **Verify seeding** - Make sure system users are seeded

### **If you see "Invalid system token":**
1. **Clear browser storage** - Clear localStorage
2. **Refresh page** - Reload the application
3. **Try different credentials** - Use another system user account

## 🎉 **Success!**

Once you successfully login with system user credentials, you'll have full access to the System User Management module with all its features!

**The authentication issue is now resolved!** 🚀
